    <p>I'm Nataliia Polonik. Nice to meet you!</p>

    <p>I'm from Odesa, Ukraine. Maybe that's the reason of my passionate love to the sea :-)<br>
    When the war started in 2022 I moved to Riga, Latvia, where I spent 2 years. I was working at the same company as in Ukraine, just a different office. In 2024 I returned to Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm a student of <a href="https://ithillel.ua/">Hillel IT School</a> attending QA Manual course.<br>
    I like studing, there is always new knowledge to get. I would like to work as a QA upon graduating.<br>
    Addtionally I study English with the teacher. Hope all this will help me to get a new job!</p>
